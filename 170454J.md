## Smart Contracts 
This is analogous to the "chaincode" concept in hyperledger fabric. Smart contracts are code/logic written into the blockchain. These consists of simple "if then ..." statements that govern the transactions on the blockchain. Smart contracts can be programmed by us(developers) but there are pre-existing templates as well.  

## Assets
Assets are stored on the blockchain in a distributed manner. Assets could be Created, Read, Updated and Deleted (i.e. CRUD operations could be performed on them similar to a database). But each asset is unique, i.e. before any new asset is created the system checks to see if another asset with the same assetID exists and if there is another then rejects the creation.
